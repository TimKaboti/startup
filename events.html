        <!--important note: when someone creates an event, they are automatically made an admin, so they would be taken to the admin page.
however, right now, I have the 'join' action only leading to the competitor screen. this will be changed because the person joining may not be the creator, but is also 
not a competitor, and is joinging to be an admin at the event. I either need to make it so in javascript, it is hypersensitive of the input, and will take you to either
depending on the code you provide(a competitor code or an admin code), or make it so there are 2 options to join the event, one for competitors to join, one
for admins to join.3-->
