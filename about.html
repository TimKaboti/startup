        <p>The Tournevent Tracker is designed to provide athletes with timely and relevant updates when at a
            competition.
            It provides to the competitor a list of individual events that the competitor expects to participate in,
            along
            with constant updates to inform the athlete that their round or match will be starting soon and where
            exactly
            they need to be;
            extremely helpful for events with large venues. Tournevent also keeps track of the competitors performance
            and
            will show them their scores or ranking.</p>
